# Integration of Data Management with Other Areas

## Why Data Management Integrates with Other Areas
- Data Management provides the foundation for storing, organizing, and maintaining data. This well-structured data is critical for performing **Data Analytics** and is required for the smooth functioning of **Software Systems**. Proper data management also ensures that data is stored securely, protecting it from breaches in **Networking and Cybersecurity**.

## How Data Management Integrates with Other Areas
- **Data Analytics:** Good data management practices ensure that data is clean and accessible for analytics processes like data visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Software Systems:** Software systems depend on databases designed and managed through SQL queries to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Networking and Cybersecurity:** Secure data storage and access control prevent unauthorized access, making data management a key component of cybersecurity.

## Integration with Prior Work
- In **CIDM 6350**, I designed and implemented relational databases using SQL queries. The structured data I managed allowed smooth integration with the analytics performed in other courses, ensuring that data was clean and secure for use in predictive modeling and business intelligence.

## New Statement on Integration
- **Data Management** serves as the backbone of any data-driven system, ensuring that data is organized, accessible, and secure. This directly supports **Data Analytics** by providing quality data, enhances **Software Systems** by streamlining data handling, and protects sensitive data within **Networking and Cybersecurity**. Together, they create an efficient, secure, and data-driven environment.
