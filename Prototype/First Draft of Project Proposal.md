# Capstone Project Proposal: Cybersecurity Auditing Tool for Small Businesses

## Project Overview
The Cybersecurity Auditing Tool aims to address the critical need for small businesses to effectively manage their cybersecurity. Many small businesses lack the resources, knowledge, or dedicated teams to conduct thorough security audits, leaving them vulnerable to cyber threats. This tool will provide an automated solution to assess IT infrastructure for vulnerabilities, suggest best practices for security improvements, and generate detailed reports to guide business owners in enhancing their cybersecurity posture.

## Problem Statement
Small businesses are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals due to their limited security resources. Without effective measures in place, they face the risk of data breaches, financial losses, and damage to their reputation. The proposed Cybersecurity Auditing Tool will empower small businesses to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with industry standards and protecting sensitive information.

## Curricular Areas and Requirements

### Prototype (Two Curricular Areas)
