# Samples and Sources of Knowledge

To develop my proficiency in the courses, I consulted a variety of resources, including:

- **Course lectures and notes**: Provided foundational knowledge and key concepts.
- **Lecture slides**: Summarized important points and methodologies for easy reference.
- **Instructional videos**: Offered visual and practical demonstrations of techniques.
- **Searching the web**: Helped me find solutions, examples, and best practices for applying methods and tools in real-world contexts.
