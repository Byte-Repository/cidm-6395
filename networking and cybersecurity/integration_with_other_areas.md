# Integration of Networking and Cybersecurity with Other Areas

## Why Networking and Cybersecurity Integrates with Other Areas
- **Networking and Cybersecurity** are essential for protecting data and systems from unauthorized access and attacks. Secure networks ensure that data handled by **Data Management** systems remains safe, while robust security measures prevent cyber threats that could compromise **Software Systems** and the insights gained from **Data Analytics**.

## How Networking and Cybersecurity Integrates with Other Areas
- **Data Analytics:** Data analytics helps in monitoring network traffic and detecting anomalies that could indicate a security breach.
- **Data Management:** Effective cybersecurity ensures that databases are protected from external threats, preventing data loss or unauthorized access.
- **Software Systems:** Secure coding practices and vulnerability assessments are essential for protecting software systems from attacks that could compromise their functionality or the data they process.

## Integration with Prior Work
- In **CIDM 6340**, I performed vulnerability assessments and conducted security audits to ensure network safety. These security measures were essential in protecting the data stored in management systems and ensuring that software systems ran smoothly without risk of external threats.

## New Statement on Integration
- **Networking and Cybersecurity** are crucial for safeguarding data and systems from external threats. This protects data managed in **Data Management** systems, ensures the safe processing of insights in **Data Analytics**, and secures the operation of **Software Systems**. Together, these areas form a strong, secure framework that supports and protects data-driven environments.
